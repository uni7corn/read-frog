feat(glossary): add user-defined glossaries

Define a term once and every AI translation uses your wording. Leave a term's translation empty to keep it
in the original language, which is usually what names and usernames need. Only the terms that actually
appear in a paragraph are sent to the model, so a large glossary costs nothing on pages that do not use it.

Terms live in glossaries, and each glossary can be limited to the websites you want it on — a set of game
terms on one wiki, work vocabulary on your company's docs, nothing anywhere else. A glossary with no
website listed applies everywhere. Where two glossaries give the same term different wording, the one
lower in the list wins.

Each term is written for one target language, chosen next to the term itself and defaulting to whatever
you currently translate into, so the same word can have a Chinese wording and a Japanese one side by side
and only the one that applies is ever sent.

Turn an individual term or a whole glossary off without deleting it, import and export each list as CSV
(now with a `targetLanguage` column; two-column files still import), or empty it in one go. Importing with
Replace asks for confirmation first, because it clears the glossary in every target language, not just the
one you picked. Find it under Advanced → Glossary in the extension settings.
