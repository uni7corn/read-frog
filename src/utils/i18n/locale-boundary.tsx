 * Applies the configured UI language to the React subtree and re-renders it on change.
 *
 * Placement: MUST sit below the jotai `Provider`/`HydrateAtoms` and `QueryClientProvider`
 * of each entrypoint (jotai recreates its store per Provider instance, so re-keying above
 * it would wipe atom state), and above the page/app content.
 *
 * Mechanism: `i18next.changeLanguage` is synchronous with bundled resources, so we apply it
 * during render (guarded) and re-key the subtree on the RESOLVED locale. This makes the
 * remounted children paint in the new language on their first render — the reason we key on
 * the resolved locale (not the raw `uiLanguage`) is that "auto"→"en" and explicit "en" must
 * not trigger a spurious remount.
